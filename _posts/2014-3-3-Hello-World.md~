title: Migrating from Wordpress to Jekyll
---

I'm switching from Wordpress to a simpler site layout based on [Barry Clark's] 
(https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) Jekyll Now project.  I'm hoping 
that it'll be less hassle than dealing with the crufty CSS that so many 
Wordpress themes have - and that the layout will be friendly for mobile 
devices as well as PCs.

It'll take a few days to migrate all the content.

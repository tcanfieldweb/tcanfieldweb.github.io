title: Implementing tags in Jekyll

Jekyll supports tagging and categorizing posts ... but not if you're publishing to GitHub, which I'm considering using.  (It's useful for version control of the code, after all.)

Unfortunately the common implementations of tagging use plugins, and GitHub doesn't support any plugins for security reasons.

I recently had a Game of Thrones-themed party, and not only used it as an 
excuse to make all kinds of things from the [*Feast of Ice and Fire* cookbook]( http://www.amazon.com/Feast-Ice-Fire-Official-Companion/dp/0345534492), 
but even found some enjoyable GoT-themed games to play.  (Enjoyable unless, I 
suppose, you're a big House Greyjoy fan.)

I've been systematically [trying all the *Feast of Ice and Fire* recipes for a 
while](/tag/game_of_thrones_cookbook.html), and my first
thought was just to make all of my favorites.  But, putting the menu 
together, I realized that board games and soup don't mix.  And 
unfortunately, judging by the cookbook, Westeros is a bit short on finger food.

When the guests arrived we passed around homemade bread and coarse salt. If 
any gluten-free types didn't take any, and thus weren't under the protection of
our hospitality, I didn't notice.

pie.</figcaption>
</figure>

I initially bought the cookbook for the medieval recipes - 
but I suspected that the mix of sweet and savory would be a bit too strange 
for some of the
guests.  (The pork pie, for example, includes ginger, honey, and dried fruit.) I
tried to strike a balance so that even fussier eaters would be able
to find something on the table they liked.

As a bonus, the beef-and-bacon filling could be made ahead of time in the crockpot.  (In fact, it pretty much has to be; if you use the stew beef the cookbook
calls for, it needs to cook for a long time to get tender.  The amount of time
needed to brown the crust won't  begin to do the job.)

<figcaption>Clockwise from upper left: Lemon cakes; medieval Arya tarts;

aioli; cold chicken and vegetables; candied fruit from Dorimare; hot
spiced wine (in the crockpot); Elizabethan buns with pine nuts, currants, 
and raisins</figcaption>
</figure>

The chicken came from the  Costco rotisserie; I'd thought of brushing it with
a honey glaze (since "honeyed chicken" turns up on the Starks' dinner table
in the books) but decided instead to mix the honey into the mustard and serve
it on the side.  The rosemary from the herb had come indoors for the
winter, so I had fresh herbs to add to the homemade 
aioli<span id="1-source"><sup>[1](#1)</sup></span>.  We figured that anyone 
who didn't want pie as a main dish
could fill up on chicken - there was plenty of homemade bread, after all -
and it was also one fewer dish I had to cook myself.

The three-by-five cards on the table listed the names of the dishes and the
regions they came from.  (I'd thought of having one dish for each of the seven
kingdoms and the Riverlands, then realized there's nothing in the Iron Islands
worth eating.)  The crystallized fruit - real figs, pears, pineapple, sweet
potato, and melon preserved in sugar syrup -
was labeled "Dorimare".  I'll spare you a puzzled search through the Game
of Thrones wikis; Dorimare is the setting of Hope Mirrlees's 1926 fantasy 
novel [Lud-in-the-Mist](http://www.amazon.com/Lud-----Mist-Hope-Mirrlees/dp/1434442179/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1453772504&sr=8-1&keywords=lud+in+the+mist), with
its intoxicating fairy fruit - which, Mirrlees says, can indeed be 
candied.  (The crystallized fruit is actually from Mexico by way of Saraga 
International Grocery.)

In addition to the hot spiced wine - the Southron, not the Northern, recipe -
we had the old-fashioned Iced Green Minty Drink from the cookbook, a mix of
green tea, mint, and honey, which we served hot
rather than cold, and a bottle of [Camelot Mead](http://www.oliverwinery.com/index.cfm?method=storeproducts.showdrilldown&productid=565D8BC6-1CC4-FBB6-23C6-013703DB5D6A&isMarketingURL=1) from
Oliver Winery.  (It's a sweet honey wine that even people who don't generally
like wine will enjoy.)

The pretty glazed pie pan with crinkled edges was made by Jake's cousin, who 
runs [Twice-Baked 
Pottery](http://www.twicebakedpottery.com/).  It's oven-safe; we tested it
the next weekend, when we wouldn't care so much if it broke and filled the
oven with pie detritus.  (Which, let us be clear, it did not do.)

Westeros might be short on appetizers, but oh, do they eat a lot of 
desserts.  I
narrowed our selection down to three.  The medieval Arya tarts have a 
peppery fruit topping
that's tasty but a little odd to modern palates, but less adventurous eaters 
could stick with the Elizabethan lemon tarts.  (Although I'd made the Arya tarts
before, I managed to forget that the dough-to-topping ratio in the recipe
is way off; I only used half the topping and still made a huge number of tarts.)

If you don't want to pay silly money for candied walnuts to top the Arya tarts
with, [they're super easy to make](http://www.marthastewart.com/318203/candied-walnuts).

Months before I'd even scheduled the party, I started freezing egg whites
whenever I made a recipe that just called for yolks.  Then, a few days in 
advance, I thawed
them out, made meringue, and piped cream swan parts onto parchment paper.  I 
ended up with NUMEROUS Tupperware containers full of crunchy little swan
components.  I realize that single blurry picture is all the evidence I had,
but there were SO MANY swans. While I was wise to make extras - the pieces
are a bit fragile - I may  have overdone it a bit.

I'd considered assembling the swans using a little royal icing, or maybe white
chocolate ganache, instead of the ice cream so they could done in
advance.  On the night of the party, though, they really were not all that
much trouble to put together.

We even had a few guests in costume, including a complete hand-embroidered
outfit that I believe had seen a few Renfaires, a Jon Snow in a black wig
and cloak, and our cat Nekojii favoring us with a rare costumed appearance.

There's a [Game of Thrones board 
game](http://www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-The-Board-Second-Edition/dp/1589947207) which
I truthfully haven't enjoyed very much.  I'm not sure the game is the problem;
we've never had experienced players, and I'm convinced we've missed an 
important sentence in the rulebook.  (Every game we tried ended in
an easy victory for the Starks, and a player who got crippled in Round 1 
had to sit politely through the game, unable to do anything but wait for the 
mercy blow.  Since GoT is well-regarded among boardgamers, I assume the problem's
with us, not it.)

Instead, we made our own Westeros-themed [Telestrations](http://www.amazon.com/Telestrations-8-Player-The-Original/dp/B001SN8GF4/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1453780664&sr=1-1&keywords=telestrations) 
cards.  (Telestrations is a telephone-like game of drawing pictures and 
guessing what they're meant
to be.)  Ideas mutate as sketchbooks pass around the table - at the party, 
"The Pointy End" turned into "Just The Tip"<span id="2-source"><sup>[2](#2)</sup></span>.

[The Inn At the Crossroads](http://www.innatthecrossroads.com/), the blog where
the Game of Thrones cookbok originated, also created a Game of Thrones version
of Cards Against Humanity: [Cards Against The Realm](http://www.innatthecrossroads.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Cards-Against-the-Realm.pdf).  (If you use them, you might do a quality control pass; some of the black cards 
call for verbs - "All men must _____" - but all the white cards are noun 
phrases.)

And of course there was Pin the Wiener on Theon Greyjoy, where guests
applied - among other things - a kraken, Ramsay Snow's horn, a dachsund, a hot dog, and a [flying phallos by Ursula 
Vernon]( http://www.redwombatstudio.com/gallery2/main.php?g2_itemId=640) to
the Prince's injured dignity.  (If you need your own photo of Balon Greyjoy's 
disapproving face, you can find one by Googling "Balon Greyjoy".)

Thanks to all who attended, and many of these recipes - and some of these 
games - will return in the future!

class="notmycover-thumbnail" />A friend bought me a used copy of Bill Fawcett's [*Cats in Space and Other Places*](
http://www.amazon.com/Cats-Space-Other-Places-Fawcett/dp/0671721186
) anthology of cat stories, which clearly came from a cat-owning home, as Nekojii immediately set about rubbing his face on the pages.  It's mostly famous stories by famous writers – Heinlein, Leiber, McCaffrey, Cordwainer Smith; 
familiar to SF readers but worth re-reading.  (In fact, this anthology probably *isn't* the best place to discover a story like Arthur C. Clarke's "Who's There?", which wants readers to forget there's a cat in the story until the big twist, or C. J. Cherryh's "Chanur's Homecoming", a novel chapter that's incomprehensible without its context.)

But the big surprise is the lone fantasy story, David Drake's "Bullhead".  The
talking cat is just a walk-on character; the story's about Old Nathan, an elderly Tennessee wizard in the early 1800s, who finds it easier to talk to the animals around him than to deal with human foolishness.

>"I'll tell ye a thing, though, cat," the cunning man said forcefully.  "Afore King's Mountain, I couldn't no more talk t' you an' t' other animals thin I could talk t' this hearth rock."

>The tomcat curled his full tail over his face, then flicked it barely aside.

>"Afore ye got yer knackers blowed off, ye mean?" the cat said.  The discussion wasn't of great concern to him, but he demanded precise language nonetheless.

>"Aye," Old Nathan said, glaring at the animal.  "Thet's what I mean."

>The cat snorted into his tail fur.  "Thin you made a durned bad bargain, old man," he said.

>Old Nathan tore his eyes away from the cat.  The tin basin was still in his left hand.  He sighed and hung it up unused.

>"Aye," he muttered.  "I reckon I did, cat."

A mountain community is a small place, and Nathan – already distrusted by his neighbors – makes one enemy after another as he sets larger matters right in ways they can never understand.

Old Nathan gained his magic after the [Battle of King's Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sevier#Battle_of_Kings_Mountain) in 1780, and the book 
deeply evokes that specific time and place &mdash; from the details of everyday life, like smoking catfish on a chimney shelf, to the language.  ("Stick to yer own affairs, boy … effen ye have sich," Old Nathan chastises one young man.)

The magic-tinged Tennessee is such a marvelous place to visit, with its sunny fields and fragrant pines, its feuding families and its forgotten debts, its dangers and its secret sentimentality, that it's almost a shame the book ends with no hope of a sequel.  Nathan has been the local wizard in these parts for decades – surely there's more to tell about him?  But Drake made the right call, and the final story brings together everything that's come before 
in a bittersweet conclusion that's more satisfying than a purely happy ending could ever be.

And I just found out that someone filmed the whole thing!

You even get corny Brazilian music!

Piron's 1983 book is often the next stop for people who've picked up a little 
Esperanto and want to learn more.  It covers all of the grammar and the most 
common words, introducing them bit by bit of the course of a detective 
story.  

Haven't learned the past tense yet?  The opening chapters don't use it - 
amateur sleuths Linda and Tom notice something odd in their 
university cafeteria and discuss it while it's still happening.  ("He has 
something in his hand … he's reaching for her cup …")  *Gerda* reminds me 
of [*Green Eggs and Ham*]( http://www.amazon.com/Green-Eggs-Ham-Dr-Seuss/dp/0394800168/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1454098318&sr=1-1&keywords=green+eggs+and+ham), which Dr. Seuss wrote when Bennet Cerf [bet him he he couldn't write a book using just fifty 
words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Eggs_and_Ham), and [*Ella Minnow 
Pea*](http://www.amazon.com/Ella-Minnow-Pea-Novel-Letters/dp/0385722435), 
with its letters that disappear from the text as they fall from the town's most famous 
statue. *Gerda*'s part of a grand tradition of language play that transmutes 
unnatural constraints into natural prose.

I mentioned that *Gerda* is funny (and, fittingly, cheesy – Esperantists as a 
group are good-natured, eager to please, and endearingly uncool).  Linda
follows a suspicious character to a restaurant and gets distracted by young 
soldiers throwing plates at each other and coffee cups at the ceiling.  A young boy threatens to trap his friend and abandon him in the mountains. (He's not *allowed* to drive, he says, but he *can*).  And two of the main characters are described as  "active, hard-working boys, with a special fondness for the somewhat fearful female students. Perhaps 
because a fearful young woman is less intimidating than a woman who's never inclined to be afraid: a woman without 
fear."<sup>[1](#1)</sup>  Every time you turn the page there's 
some new WTFness (a *kiodiablea&#309;o*?)

But where might we find this city where school nurses, police officers, and 
passing children speak Esperanto?

Esperanto's detractors tediously repeat "Esperanto will never replace the 
natural languages" as if it's some kind of unblockable ninja attack that will 
force Esperantists to go do something else with their time.  The Esperantists,
in turn, respond wearily that replacing other languages isn't the point – 
Esperanto is meant to be a politically neutral, easy-to-learn language that allows people to talk to each other without having to learn an existing language, with all its irregularities and social and political baggage. (Both groups are 
right.)

So let's think like science fiction fans.  (I mean "let's reason about 
the book based on what's in it and what we know about
the real world", not "let's insist that we've discovered the only right way
to read this book and flame anyone who disagrees.")  Esperanto 
isn't likely to ever displace a community's existing language.  Therefore, we can deduce that many of the characters in *Gerda* probably
speak some other language as well - but they also speak Esperanto fluently 
enough that it's a natural first choice when talking to strangers.

Perhaps Esperanto is widely taught as a second language in the local schools,
and fluency is required for civic employees?  That would explain our 
university-student heroes Bob, Tom, and Linda, and the other university
employees and police officers who turn up.

So this is a bilingual city.  But maybe we can take this reasoning one step
further.  If most people in this city spoke exactly two languages -
Esperanto and an unspecified natural language - you might expect a lot of them
to switch to their native language when talking to someone else who 
knew it.  The habit might also keep a lot of them from ever becoming truly
fluent in Esperanto; they'd end up more like the people who take four years
of Spanish in high school, and two in college, and still can't put a sentence
together.  Perhaps the reason no one in *Gerda* is inclined to drop into some
other language is that *two* - or more - native languages are commonly spoken 
here,
and not everyone's bilingual in both.  As a result, everyone is motivated
to 
learn Esperanto - not just because it's a mandatory course in school or required
for all the good jobs, but because it's easier to speak to people who don't 
speak
your language by learning Esperanto than it is to learn their native language.

But what about those two kids who speak Esperanto when they're alone together?

For all the popularity of foreign-language flashcards for kids, and after-school
French programs, and German CDs for babies, none of these products can teach
kids to converse - much less motivate them to try without an adult standing over 
them.  And yet
the schoolboys in *Gerda* get up to all their mischief in Esperanto.  They must
be picking it up at home - the Esperanto, I mean, not the mischief.

There are indeed [native speakers of 
Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Esperanto_speakers) - they're
called *denaskuloj*, and they typically have parents who met at an Esperanto
event and speak Esperanto at home.  (Sometimes they fall in love without being
able to talk to each other in any language *except* Esperanto.) The kids grow 
up fluent in both Esperanto and whatever other languages
are spoken around them - kids are just sponges when it comes to language 
learning, at least if they're immersed in them and using them, not just 
listening to
the numbers one through ten on a Xhosa phone app.  The unnamed schoolboys
in *Gerda* must  be *denaskuloj*.  Maybe they don't have another common language; maybe they do, but they're equally comfortable in Esperanto.

*Denaskuloj* are somewhat uncommon - no one knows the exact numbers, but 
there are
perhaps a thousand in the whole world.  What are the odds of two of them 
just happening to live
in the same school district?  (We know the boys aren't brothers, because one boy
talks about the other's parents.)

It's not impossible that two couples just happened to set up Esperantist
households in a city where so many people speak Esperanto in everyday life ...
but isn't it more likely that it happened the other way around?  

We've already deduced that not everyone in the area shares a common native 
language, and that Esperanto is widely used as a second language.  We might
also conclude that Esperanto became so widespread here a while ago - at a 
minimum, several years before the two children were born.  As a result, when 
people
who speak different native languages fall in love and get married, they
naturally speak the language they have in common at home.  So their kids
grow up immersed in Esperanto and become native speakers.
 
Clearly we can conclude *Gerda* is set in an Esperanto utopia, where everyone 
learns it as a second
language and the local native languages are still thriving.  (Can a crime story
really take place in a utopia?  Well, the investigating police do point out that
these are amateur criminals, and they don't manage to cause much harm.  So
perhaps it really is a utopia that's so short of perfection that it feels petty
to quibble.)

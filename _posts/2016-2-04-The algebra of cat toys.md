"$4.50 PKG (2)", said the [American Science and Surplus](http://www.sciplus.com/p/FELINE-FEATHERED-FLINGERS_56120)
listing.  $2.25 apiece seemed a little steep for some feathers glued to a 
weight, but our cat loves them.  He chirps when they come down from the top
of the fridge.  He sings them a little song.  He chases them with so much
gusto he spins out on the kitchen floor.  And, bit by bit, they get deplumed.

Compared with the occasional vet bill, what's $2.25?  Might as well get
two sets and have four little flingers - or, why not, four sets and have 
eight.  American Science & Surplus's shipping is reasonable, but it's not
free, so you're better off consolidating orders anyway.

Today the package arrived and I found this.

PKG (2) does not mean two flingers per package.  It means you get two 
packages.  With four flingers apiece.

So now I have thirty-two (32) feathered flingers.  I assume Nekojii will
have nibbled them all to pieces by this time tomorrow.

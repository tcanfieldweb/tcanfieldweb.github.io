Some friends are keeping logs of everything they read in 2016, and I joined the club.  These are just books I finished, with one exception, so I don't have to keep adding the same books in progress month after month.

<img src="/images/covers/fforde-something-rotten.jpg" class="notmycover-thumbnail" />[*The Well Of Lost Plots*]( http://www.amazon.com/Well-Lost-Plots-Thursday-Series/dp/0143034359)

[*Something Rotten*]( http://www.amazon.com/Something-Rotten-Thursday-Next-Novels/dp/014303541X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1454638070&sr=1-1&keywords=something+rotten+fforde)

[*First Among Sequels*]( http://www.amazon.com/First-Among-Sequels-Thursday-Next/dp/0143113569/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1454638100&sr=1-1&keywords=first+among+sequels)

**Jasper Fforde** (all from his Thursday Next series)

Both rereads.  Absurd comedy, but with surprising amount of drama - this 
world of
coin-operated Shakespeare machines, genetically engineered pet dodos, and
Welsh cheese smuggling isn't any funnier to its inhabitants than our world
is to us.  Which isn't to say it's not funny to us.  I just wish there was
a spin-off about the Toast Promotion Board.

<img src="/images/covers/margaret-st-clair-best-of.jpg" class="notmycover-thumbnail" />[*The Best of Margaret St. Clair*](http://www.amazon.com/Best-Margaret-St-Clair/dp/0897331648/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1454638145&sr=1-1&keywords=best+of+margaret+st.+clair)

Golden-age SF writer, perhaps best remembered for "Brightness Falls from the 
Air".  "Horrer Howce" terrified me as a kid - and traumatized my brother for
years when I recounted the plot to him.  Highly recommend to people with
little brothers.

<img src="/images/covers/butcher_white_night.jpg" class="notmycover-thumbnail" />[*Proven Guilty*]( http://www.amazon.com/Proven-Guilty-Dresden-Files-Book/dp/0451461037)

[*White Knight*]( http://www.amazon.com/White-Night-Dresden-Files-Book/dp/045146155X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1454638219&sr=1-1&keywords=butcher+white+night)

**Jim Butcher** (both from his *Dresden Files* series)

What I like best about Butcher is that no matter how tangled his plots get,
every revelation fits perfectly with what's come before.  Nothing feels
tacked on; nothing feels like a last-minute addition.

The downside is that some of his books are mostly setup for what will come 
later.  Oh, and Butcher spends a lot of time quoting famous movies without
adding any twist of his own.  "Remember that thing you like? Yeah, I remember it too."

<img src="/images/covers/horror-orient-express.jpg" class="notmycover-thumbnail" />[*Horror on the Orient Express, vols. I – V*]( http://www.amazon.com/Horror-Orient-Express-Continent-roleplaying/dp/1568823908/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1454638285&sr=1-1&keywords=horror+on+the+orient+express)

Several hundred pages detailing out a continent-spanning, tabletop RPG horror adventure.  Deserves its own posts and will get them.

<img src="/images/covers/FateCoreBookCover.jpg" class="notmycover-thumbnail" />[*Fate Core System*]( http://www.amazon.com/Fate-Roleplaying-Leonard-Balsera-Hardcover/dp/B00LLOLGL6/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1454638318&sr=1-1&keywords=fate+core+system)

[*The Fate Toolkit*]( http://www.amazon.com/Evil-Productions-System-Toolkit-September/dp/B015X40A8E/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1454638346&sr=1-4&keywords=fate+toolkit)


*Orient Express* is written for the Call of Cthulhu rules, but I'm going to
run it using *Fate*, which I've come to prefer.

<img src="/images/covers/jordan-being-colloquial-esperanto.jpg" class="notmycover-thumbnail" />[*Being Colloquial in Esperanto: A Reference Guide*](http://www.amazon.com/Being-Colloquial-Esperanto-Reference-Guide/dp/0939785048/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1454638370&sr=1-1&keywords=being+colloquial+in+esperanto)

**David K. Jordan**

The world needs more foreign language books like this one.  It's intended
for people who already know Esperanto to some extent and discusses hundreds
of common mistakes (especially frequently-confused words) as well of typical
expressions and constructions that you'd expect to hear among Esperantists
with different first languages.  And the examples are witty; "I wanted to 
answer your letter, but worms ate my pencil."  (*"Mi volis respondi al via
letero, sed vermoj formanĝis la krajonon."*)

Honor compels me to point out that the author has put 
[the whole book up for 
free](http://pages.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/eo/colloq/colloq.html) online.

<img src="/images/covers/alice-in-a-world-of-wonderlands.jpg" class="notmycover-thumbnail" />[*Alice in a World of Wonderlands*]( http://www.amazon.com/Alice-World-Wonderlands-Translations-Masterpiece/dp/1584563311/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1454638462&sr=1-1&keywords=alice+in+a+world+of+wonderlands)

[*The Annotated Alice*]( http://www.amazon.com/Annotated-Alice-Definitive-Lewis-Carroll/dp/0393048470/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1454638434&sr=1-2&keywords=annotated+alice)

An exception to my "read the whole book before listing it" rule: *Alice in a
World of Wonderlands* is three enormous volumes, one of which is a list of all
known translations.  No one except *perhaps* the editor will ever read this
cover to cover.  The
other two volumes discuss translations of the *Alice* books into ONE HUNDRED AND
SEVENTY-FOUR different languages.  There are essays comparing every Alice
translation into a given language; there are essays discussing how
various approaches to translation have been applied to *Alice* over the years;
there are in-depth examinations of how specific translators have approached the
wordplay and cultural references.

These are wonderful books to sit down with and flip through, reading about
how languages you know and languages you'll never know have handled the Mad
Tea Party - but I doubt I will read everything here in my lifetime.

It did, though, inspire me to re-read the *Alice* books.  *The Annotated Alice*
has the original text and illustrations, plus copious notes in the margins by
mathematician Martin Gardner - who's happy to point out any Victorianism the 
original readers might have taken for granted, or include the full text of
the poems Carroll mocks.

<img src="/images/covers/mauboussin-think-twice.jpg" class="notmycover-thumbnail" />[*Think Twice: Harnessing the Power of Counterintuition*]( http://www.amazon.com/Think-Twice-Harnessing-Power-Counterintuition/dp/1422187381/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1454638482&sr=1-1&keywords=mauboussin+think+twice)

**Michael J. Mauboussin**

Non-fiction about cognitive illusions - those times when we believe we're thinking logically, but we're just fooling ourselves.  And we usually don't notice.
